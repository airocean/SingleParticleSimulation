# SingleParticleSimulation
Homework about the single particle simulation from the course of fundamental of plasma physics at USTC.

The mathematical principle is the finite differential method. It is based on the differential equation as
$$
\cfrac{\partial}{\partial x}u=\lim_{\Delta x\rightarrow0}\cfrac{u(x+\Delta x)-u(x)}{\Delta x}\simeq\cfrac{u(x+\Delta x)-u(x)}{\Delta x}.
